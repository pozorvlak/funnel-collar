 We like to store dry goods (lentils, rice, flour, couscous, porridge...) in empty 4pt milk jugs - they're easy to pour from, line up neatly, and are translucent so you can see at a glance what you're running short of. The tricky bit is filling the jugs up. This Thing allows you to make a screw-on funnel out of another milk jug, so you can securely and easily fill your storage jugs up.

This Thing was made in OpenSCAD, based on code by Andrew Plumb (@clothbot). You can fork the code on GitHub: github.com/pozorvlak/funnel-collar

Measurements are based on UK milk jug lids. It fits all brands of milk jug I've
tried so far, though it's a bit snug on Tesco ones. The SCAD file is
parametric, so it should be easy to adjust this to other countries' milk jugs
if need be.

Instructions
------------

1. Take N+1 empty milk jugs (where N is the number of ingredients you wish to store), wash them out, and leave them to dry.
2. Cut off the top half of one of the jugs. This will become the funnel.
3. Print out this collar. You probably want dense infill and thick walls.
4. Screw the collar onto the funnel.
5. Screw the collar + funnel onto one of the milk jugs.
6. Fill it with whatever ingredient you want.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have filled all N jugs.
8. Bask in the beauty of your newly-organised kitchen.

You don't, of course, have to fill all N jugs at once. Start with two, and fill up more as you finish more milk jugs.
